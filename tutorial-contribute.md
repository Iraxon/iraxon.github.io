## Intro

Welcome! Thank you for choosing to contribute to the tutorials; contributions like yours are what keep it useful for everyone.

- The repository for this site is at [github.com/iraxon/iraxon.github.io](https://github.com/iraxon/iraxon.github.io).
- VSCode is the recommended IDE for working on this site. The recommended extensions are included in the .vscode folder of the repository.
- Until our tutorials for Github and VSCode are up, you will need to use external resources to learn how to use them. (These tutorials are high priority. Those of you who already know how should focus your effort on getting those tutorials finished.)
