# Tutorial: GitHub

## Prerequisites

- None

## Intro

GitHub is a service that allows you to save your code online and work with other people on the same projects.

## Making an account

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com). Click "Sign up" in the top right corner and follow Github's instructions.

GitHub itself will provide a mini-tutorial that teaches you how to make a repository. You only need to know this to start your own projects.

GitHub is not an integrated development environment (IDE). You will not go to GitHub to write code. Its purpose is to allow you to save and share code. (Codespaces, made by the same company, is an IDE, but it is not recommended.)
